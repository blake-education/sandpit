# Here's a typical coffeescript file from Blake Education!
# Multiple lines with this one so you can try adding stuff in between them to test the line endings.  2
# Another test
# Playing around with Notepad++ EOL conversions.
# This line was added before doing an EOL conversion to "Macintosh"
# This line was added before doing an EOL conversion to "Windows"
# New line because changing EOL formats from Macintosh to Windows will cause an entire code change.  So this should just be a line insertion for this one.
# And one more test for good measure... a conversion from "Windows" to "Unix" line endings using Edit>EOL conversion again.
# This should be handled elegantly by Git during the push via the "autocrlf = true" setting.
# New line without changing EOL format (still Unix)
# Change 1
# Like, maybe insert a new line between these previous lines to see if Github shows just the insertion or if it does the whole body of code again?

#Making a change to see the updated
